The dataset was downloaded from Qiita (https://qiita.ucsd.edu/) with study ID 1011, which consists of 98 samples and 6674 OTUs. We selected the caffeine intake as the outcome of interest since caffeine intake was found to have a significant impact on the
gut microbiota . We aimed to predict the caffeine intake based on the OTU abundances.
